# Legal Status & Usage Rights

This corpus is assembled strictly for educational research and falls under fair use (17 U.S.C. § 107).

## Public Domain Materials
Short stories published before 1964 without copyright renewal (e.g., *2BR02B*, *The Big Trip Up Yonder*, *Unready to Wear*, *Harrison Bergeron*) reside in `data/vonnegut_corpus/public_domain/` and may be pushed to public repositories.

## Educational Fair-Use Materials
Publisher excerpts, interviews, speeches, essays, and letters live in `data/vonnegut_corpus/educational_fair_use/`. These include official promotional previews from Penguin Random House and freely available interviews from outlets such as Playboy and In These Times. They are included solely for research and instructional design. Keep this folder private (use a private repo, gated cloud storage, or the provided .gitignore rules) unless you have explicit redistribution rights.

## Usage Guidelines
- Do not redistribute full copyrighted works.
- Attribute original publishers when citing excerpts.
- Limit deployments to password-protected demos or research studies.
- Remove any excerpt immediately upon request from rights holders.
- Document every source in `data/corpus_manifest.json` (generated by `python build_corpus_index.py`).

By contributing to this project, you agree to uphold these restrictions and to pursue separate licensing arrangements for any broader release.
