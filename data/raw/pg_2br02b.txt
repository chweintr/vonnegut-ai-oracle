Everything was perfectly swell.

There were no prisons, no slums, no insane asylums, no cripples, no poverty, no wars.

All diseases were conquered. So was old age.

Death, barring accidents, was an adventure for volunteers.

The population of the United States was stabilized at forty-million souls.

One bright morning in the Chicago Lying-in Hospital, a man named Edward K. Wehling, Jr., waited for his wife to give birth. He was the only man waiting. Not many people were born a day any more.

Wehling was fifty-six, a mere stripling in a population whose average age was one hundred and twenty-nine.

X-rays had revealed that his wife was going to have triplets. The children would be his first.

Young Wehling was hunched in his chair, his head in his hand. He was so rumpled, so still and colorless as to be virtually invisible. His camouflage was perfect, since the waiting room had a disorderly and demoralized air, too. Chairs and ashtrays had been moved away from the walls. The floor was paved with spattered dropcloths.

The room was being redecorated. It was being redecorated as a memorial to a man who had volunteered to die.

A sardonic old man, about two hundred years old, sat in a wheel chair, supervising the redecorating. His name was Dr. Hitz. He was a government official, a man with a lot of talents.

"Another shot of paint on that window sill, my man," said Dr. Hitz.

A painter took aim and let fly. He missed the window sill and spattered the wall instead.

"Try it again," said Dr. Hitz. "A little more to the left this time."

The painter tried again. He hit a chair instead of the sill.

"Well," said Dr. Hitz, "I'll be darned if you're not getting worse instead of better. Let me show you how to do it." He took the brush from the painter.

"Now," said Dr. Hitz, "you want to hold the brush lightly." He put the brush to the window sill. "You want to let the brush do the work." He drew the brush along the sill. "There," he said, satisfied. "That's the way to do it."

Young Wehling, the waiting father, mumbled something without lifting his head. And then he fell silent again.

A coarse, formidable woman strode into the waiting room on spike heels. Her shoes, stockings, trench coat, bag and overseas cap were all the color of a New York City taxicab. She had an armband which said in big letters, "SERVICE DIVISION, Federal Bureau of Termination," which showed that she was an employee of the federal government.

"Where's 56?" she said. In Duluth, Minnesota, in the year 2158 A.D., people were commonly referred to by their serial numbers.

"I'm 56," said Wehling.

She ignored Wehling, and spoke to Dr. Hitz. "This is service call 681 of 1958," she said. "Where do I go to get my money?"

"See the clerks in the outer office," said Dr. Hitz. "Say--" He offered the woman a cigar.

"I don't smoke," she said curtly.

"a shame," said Dr. Hitz. "Gives so much pleasure for such a small price."

The woman was gone.

"There's one thing I like about her," said Dr. Hitz. "She's one of the few who doesn't want to talk about the old days." He turned to the painter, who was on a stepladder. "Use a little more paint on that top molding, my man."

A janitor came in, pushing a cart. On the cart were stacks of ash trays, matches, magazines, and lollipops. He began setting ash trays on tables, two lollipops beside each ash tray. The magazines were all old ones. The newest was thirty years old.

Dr. Hitz called to the janitor: "You! What's your number?"

"82," said the janitor.

"From 82, I'd like to ask you something, 82," said Dr. Hitz.

"Yes, sir."

"How old are you?"

"Fifty-three next week, sir."

"And how old was your father when he died?"

"He didn't die, sir. He's about to be called up any time now."

"I see. And how old was your mother when she died?"

"She didn't die either, sir. She's about to be called, too."

"Uh-huh," said Dr. Hitz. "Well--carry on, 82."

"Yes, sir."

Dr. Hitz turned to the painter again. "That looks very good," he said. "Very good indeed."

Gramps, the old man supervising the redecorating, held out his hand to the painter. "Let me try," he said.

Young Wehling looked up at last. His wife had just had her triplets. A doctor came out of the delivery room.

"Congratulations," said the doctor. "How about a cigar?"

"I--" said Wehling.

"Oh, I see," said the doctor. "You don't smoke. How about a drink?"

"I--" said Wehling.

"You don't drink, either. You seem to be unique. What do you do for pleasure?"

"I--" said Wehling.

"What's that? Speak up."

"I worry," said Wehling.

The doctor was only forty-two years old. He wasn't used to seeing a patient worry. "What do you worry about?" he said.

Wehling stood up. "The babies," he said. "What's going to happen to them?"

"Why," said the doctor, "they're going to live forever, just like you. Why should you worry about that?"

"Forever?" said Wehling.

"Unless they have an accident," said the doctor.

"An accident," said Wehling.

"That's the only way anyone dies nowadays. Did you know that?"

"I--no," said Wehling.

"Well, it is. How old are you?"

"Fifty-six."

"You look like a young man. You are a young man. Would you believe me if I told you that some of the people working in this hospital are over two hundred years old?"

"No," said Wehling.

"I myself am forty-two," said the doctor. "But I look--what? Twenty-five? And I feel like a kid, too. They'll have to shoot me before I'll believe I'm getting old." He laughed.

Dr. Hitz had been listening to the conversation. He came over, dragging his wheel chair.

"Shooting?" said Dr. Hitz. "Who said anything about shooting?" He was very upset. "What do you mean--shooting?"

"It was a figure of speech," said the doctor. "All I meant was--"

"I know what you meant," said Dr. Hitz. "You meant that someone might take it into his head to murder you. Well, that's not going to happen, not as long as I'm around to watch things. Nobody commits murder any more. Nobody commits suicide, either. Nobody does anything unpleasant any more. But the way you talk--"

"I'm sorry," said the doctor.

"You should be," said Dr. Hitz. He turned to Wehling. "As for you, young man, may I ask why you're so worried?"

"The babies," said Wehling. "I understand that I can have them if I want them. But somebody has to die before they can live. That's the law, isn't it?"

"That's the law," said Dr. Hitz.

"Somebody I love will have to die," said Wehling.

"Not necessarily somebody you love," said Dr. Hitz. "The law says simply that somebody has to volunteer. It doesn't have to be anybody you know. It could be somebody from a list of volunteers."

"That's not much better," said Wehling.

"I think it's very good," said Dr. Hitz. "Before the population control laws, people had big families, and the old folks starved or froze to death--or got sick and died miserably. Now, when somebody has a baby, somebody else volunteers to go--and he goes happily, knowing that he's making room for new life. I think it's beautiful."

"You think it's beautiful," said Wehling.

"I do," said Dr. Hitz. "There's nothing morbid about it. People don't cling to life the way they used to. Life isn't such a big deal any more. We've learned to be happy with the idea of dying. Before the population control laws, everybody was afraid to die. Death was a terrible thing. It was horrible. It was something to be fought. But now death is a friend."

"Death is a friend," said Wehling.

"That's right. A person volunteers to die when his time comes. And his time comes whenever it's needed. Like right now, for instance. Your wife just had triplets. Three people have to volunteer to die."

"Three?"

"One for each baby."

Wehling went very pale. "I--I didn't know it was three. I thought it was just one."

"Oh, my, no," said Dr. Hitz. "Where on earth did you get that idea?"

"I don't know. I--" Wehling shook his head. "Three people have to die, so my three babies can live?"

"That's the way the cookie crumbles," said Dr. Hitz.

A machine in the next room went beep-beep-beep-beep-beep. This was the signal that someone had volunteered to die.

Dr. Hitz listened to the beeps. "Five beeps!" he said. "My goodness--someone's having quintuplets!"

The beeping stopped.

Dr. Hitz sighed. "Well, that's that. Someone just volunteered to die." He turned to Wehling again. "You see how easy it is? When the time comes for you, it'll be just as easy. You'll be happy to go."

"Happy?" said Wehling.

"Oh, yes. You'll be amazed how happy you'll be. Almost everybody's happy to go, when the time comes. They're tired of living. You get very tired of living, after a hundred years or so."

"I'm fifty-six," said Wehling.

"You're still a baby," said Dr. Hitz. "You have no idea what old age is like. But when you're really old, you'll welcome death. You'll probably volunteer even if nobody needs to die."

"What if I don't want to live that long?" said Wehling.

"What do you mean?" said Dr. Hitz.

"What if I want to die now?"

Dr. Hitz was shocked. "Die now?" he said. "You're a young man! You're at the height of your powers! Your life is just beginning!"

"But I don't want to live," said Wehling.

Dr. Hitz stared at him. "This is very unusual," he said. "I've never heard of such a thing. A young man wanting to die--"

"I can't stand the idea of living in a world where people have to die so babies can be born," said Wehling.

"But that's the way things are," said Dr. Hitz. "That's the way they have to be. We can't have unlimited population growth. We learned that lesson long ago."

"Then I don't want to be part of it," said Wehling.

"Part of what?"

"Part of a world where people have to die for other people."

Dr. Hitz was becoming impatient. "Look," he said, "you're being unreasonable. This is a perfect world. There's no suffering. There's no want. There's no disease. There's no old age. People live for hundreds of years, and when they finally die, they die happy. What more could you want?"

"I could want a world where people don't have to die for other people," said Wehling.

"But that's impossible," said Dr. Hitz. "We can't support unlimited population. We'd all starve."

"Then maybe," said Wehling, "the human race isn't worth perpetuating."

Dr. Hitz was aghast. "What a terrible thing to say!" he exclaimed.

Wehling walked over to where the gas chamber was. A leash hung from the doorknob. He put the leash around his neck.

"Mr. Wehling!" cried Dr. Hitz. "What are you doing?"

"I'm volunteering," said Wehling.

"But you can't! You're too young! You have babies to live for!"

"I don't want to live for babies who can only live because other people die," said Wehling.

He opened the door to the gas chamber and stepped inside.

Dr. Hitz tried to follow him, but Wehling slammed the door.

Through the window, Dr. Hitz could see Wehling inside the chamber. Wehling had found the button that would release the gas. His hand was poised over it.

"Mr. Wehling!" shouted Dr. Hitz. "Think of your children!"

"I am thinking of them," said Wehling. He pressed the button.

The gas came out of jets in the ceiling. In a matter of seconds, it was all over.

Dr. Hitz stared through the window at Wehling's body. The painter and the janitor came over to look, too.

"Well, I'll be darned," said the painter.

"Did you ever see anything like that?" said the janitor.

"Never," said Dr. Hitz. "In all my years, I've never seen anyone volunteer so young. And triplets, too. Usually triplets are happy occasions."

A hostess came in. "Excuse me, Dr. Hitz," she said. "I was told to ask you about the Wehling triplets. Are there three volunteers?"

"There are now," said Dr. Hitz. "Mr. Wehling just volunteered."

"Just one?" said the hostess.

"That's right."

"But we need three volunteers for triplets."

"I know that," said Dr. Hitz. "Mr. Wehling was one. We need two more."

The hostess looked around the room. Her eyes fell on the painter.

"You, sir," she said. "How old are you?"

"Seventy-two," said the painter.

"Excellent," said the hostess. "Would you like to volunteer?"

"Volunteer for what?" said the painter.

"To die," said the hostess. "We need two more volunteers so the Wehling triplets can live."

The painter put down his brush. "Well," he said, "I have been feeling pretty tired lately."

"Wonderful," said the hostess.

The painter walked over to the gas chamber. He opened the door and looked inside at Wehling's body.

"Excuse me," he said to the body. "I hope you don't mind if I join you."

He stepped into the chamber and closed the door behind him.

Through the window, Dr. Hitz and the janitor watched the painter press the button. The gas came out of the jets. In a few seconds, the painter was dead, too.

"Well," said Dr. Hitz, "that's two."

The hostess turned to the janitor. "You, sir," she said. "How old are you?"

"Fifty-three," said the janitor.

"That's very young," said the hostess. "Are you sure you want to volunteer?"

"Want to?" said the janitor. "I don't know. I guess so. I mean, if it's for babies..."

"It is," said the hostess.

"Well, then," said the janitor, "I guess it's okay."

He walked over to the gas chamber. He opened the door and looked in at the two bodies.

"Getting crowded in there," he said.

He squeezed in and closed the door.

Dr. Hitz watched through the window as the janitor pressed the button. The gas came out of the jets. In a few seconds, the janitor was dead, too.

"There," said the hostess. "Three volunteers. The Wehling triplets can live."

"Yes," said Dr. Hitz. "They can live." He paused. "I wonder what kind of world they'll make."

"The same kind we made, I suppose," said the hostess.

"Yes," said Dr. Hitz. "I suppose they will."

The hostess started to leave, then turned back.

"Dr. Hitz?" she said.

"Yes?"

"Thank you for your help."

"Don't mention it," said Dr. Hitz.

After the hostess left, Dr. Hitz sat alone in the waiting room. The redecorating was finished. The room looked nice and fresh.

He wheeled his chair over to the window and looked out at the city. It was a beautiful city. There were no slums, no poverty, no crime. Everyone was healthy and happy.

It was a perfect world.

He wondered why it felt so empty.
