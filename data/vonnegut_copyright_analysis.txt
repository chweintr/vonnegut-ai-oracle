FAIR USE LIMITATIONS FOR CORPUS BUILDING:
- Academic quotes: 200-300 words per work maximum
- Short excerpts for analysis/criticism: Acceptable
- Extensive text extraction: Requires permission
- Full book reproduction: Copyright infringement

PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR AI CORPUS:
❌ Cannot use complete novels as training material
❌ Cannot extract large passages or chapters  
✅ Can use brief quotes with attribution
✅ Can focus on interviews, speeches, public appearances
✅ Can use biographical and critical analysis containing quotes

RECOMMENDED CORPUS STRATEGY:
1. Maximize public domain materials (very limited)
2. Focus on interviews, speeches, lectures (substantial content available)
3. Use fair use quotes sparingly for voice pattern examples
4. Prioritize Archive.org audio transcriptions 
5. Emphasize non-fiction writing and public appearances

CONCLUSION:
Access to Vonnegut's complete book texts is severely limited by copyright law. The corpus must be built primarily from:
- Public speeches and interviews
- Commencement addresses  
- Audio/video transcriptions
- Academic fair use excerpts
- Public domain short stories (minimal)

This explains why interviews and speeches are the high-value targets for authentic voice pattern collection.
