# Slaughterhouse-Five Excerpt Placeholder
# -------------------------------------------------------
# Add a 500-1000 word excerpt that best illustrates:
#   • Billy Pilgrim's time-travel episodes and Tralfamadorian philosophy
#   • The Dresden destruction and "So it goes" refrain
#   • Interplay between fatalism and dark humor
#
# Usage:
#   Replace everything below this comment block with the excerpt text.
#   Keep it under ~1000 words to stay within fair-use guidelines.
#   Avoid adding analysis here—the AI guide handles commentary.
#
# NOTE: This placeholder exists because copyrighted text cannot
#       be bundled inside the repository. Paste the excerpt locally
#       before running the learning guide.
